					I am Alvin P. Garces 20 years old from San Quintin, Abra but temporarily residence at Tamag, Vigan City. I have 4 brothers and i am the second eldest of them. During my vacant time i'm always busy with my laptop watching tiutorials movies and playing games. I love also playing basketball.<br><br>
					I took up this course because iwant to follow the steps of my brother and now he is a senior web developer at lifedata corporation.<br><br>
					I have a girlfriend her name is Richelle Romano who inspired me to be a successfull in life, to become a profesional someday someday hopefully.She always help me when i was down and she is very understandable. She is not only my girlfriend, sometimes she is my bestfriend, my sister but most specially my teacher.<br><br>
					My motto in life is "respect other people what ever their age, conditions to gain a respect also from them"...
