					<h3>History of San Quintin, Abra</h3>
					<p>San Quintin was known to the outside civilization of the first time in 1662 through the mission report of Fr. Juan Pajera who organized several missions in Abra.
					Talamey, the early name of San Quintin the adjacent village. Palang were earlier known to have always been in continuous warfare with the villages of Tayong 
					(now Tayum) a nd Bukaw (now Dolores). This impression changed only when in 1820, French surgeon Paul de le Ginoniere made a stop over in Palang on his visit to Abra in 1820, 
					describing the settlement as peaceful and simple.</p>
					
					<p>
					The first record on the Christianization of Talamey was in 1872 when Fr. Bernardo Lago received pagan-converts. Talamey became a mission station and later became a pueblo in 1868
					with the same San Quintin. However, it was a part of Pidigan and it was only in 1884 that it was officially separated.
